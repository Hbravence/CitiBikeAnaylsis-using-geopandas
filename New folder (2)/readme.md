# CitiBike Exploration
## By Hunter Bravence

## Dataset
> The dataset was over bike sharing data in New York city, the data was provided by citibank which helped fund the biks sharing, theirs is new data every month. The data that I choose to analyze was Janurary through december in 2019. I also another step of the data wrangling process was finding a geojson file of New Yorks city boroughs

## Summury of findings
> During the analysis we found that men are the majority of the riders in 2019, they were tyipcally subscribers of the service and between ages 30 and 40. The majority of the time that the people were using this service was before and after the work day, most likely using the bike sharing service to help the commute.

>Their was a signficant amount of less riders who were just single use customer, but thier count goes steadly up through out the day. So with that thought I think the single use customer are tourist.

> Also It was interesting to see that this ride sharing program isn't through out the five bourgh, but their are a signifcant amount of rides in jersey city which is right next to the island of Manhattan. If you look at citi bike website you can see more station stops than what is in the map on the presentation. So parhaps the are continually adding bike sharing stations or some might not be that popular.

>Their didn't seem to be a difference in how far people traveled but it took the single time users longer to get to starting and stopping point then it did the subscribers.

> Men did seem that they did travel further but that could have been because they were double the amount of males riders compared to female riders
> Their was a weird observation their was a lot of people with unkown gender that said their birth year was in 1970.
